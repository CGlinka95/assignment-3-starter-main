# Favourite Books Tracker

A small application that I built as an assignment in class. It is made with react and a custom JavaScript backend. 

## Purpose

To allow the user (probably just me) to add their favourite books to a list, along with the associated author and rating that they have given the book.

## Dependancies - Frontend

- react.js
- react-icons
- material ui (mui)
- roboto font style

## Dependancies - Backend

- json-server

### Steps to run the project

1) Run 'npm install' in the root folder to install all dependancies for both the frontend and backend folders.
2) Run 'npm run server' in a backend folder terminal to run the server so that it is listening to the correct localhost.
3) Run 'npm run dev' in a separate frontend folder terminal to run the website on a localhost.
